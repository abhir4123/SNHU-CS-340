# SNHU-CS-340

To write maintainable, readable, and adaptable code, I focused on using clear variable names, consistent formatting, and modular structure. This was especially important in Project One, where I created a CRUD Python module to connect to MongoDB. By separating the database logic into its own file, I was able to reuse it easily in Project Two when building the dashboard. This modularity made debugging easier and allowed me to make changes to the database logic without affecting the rest of the application. In the future, I could reuse this same CRUD module in other dashboards or backend services that interact with MongoDB, which would save time and ensure consistency.

I approach problems by first breaking them down into smaller parts, then planning out my solution step by step. For this project, I carefully analyzed Grazioso Salvare’s requirements, especially how they wanted the dashboard to filter and display specific dog profiles. Compared to other assignments, this project required more attention to user interaction and real-world data filtering. I used a design-first approach, testing each part as I built it, and I referred to documentation and previous code to guide my decisions. In future projects, I’d continue using this structured method, and I’d also consider user experience early on to make sure my solutions are both functional and intuitive.

Computer scientists solve real-world problems using technology and code. In this project, my work helped a company like Grazioso Salvare by creating a tool that saves them time and improves decision-making. Instead of manually searching for dogs that match certain criteria, their team can now filter and view candidates instantly through the dashboard. This not only improves efficiency but also helps them rescue and train dogs faster. Projects like this show how computer science can make a real impact on organizations by turning raw data into actionable insights.
